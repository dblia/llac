-- general fixes

AST_FIXES:
 remove string name from ast in cases where i hold it in entry struct
 remove el_len from E_ArrayEl (don't needed anymore)

-- error handling

syntax error can improved?

add error and warning counters

add pretty_printing with args

improve symbol.ml printing info

-- lexer

what happens with string and hex ?

--check what happens in the following example

let rec a (x : int) : int = a1 + 1
and a1 : int = 2

***** in typecheckin create a field in ast for assigning the expr_type
      and actually make the typeOf and typeOfExpr function mutually recursive
      This will be done by a struct eg.

       type sem_val = {
            expr_type: typ
        }

-- a master Makefile to handle the sub-Makefiles
-- currently stopping the lexing when a false token found.
   i should change this
